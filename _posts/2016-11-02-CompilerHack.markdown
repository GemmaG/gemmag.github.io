title: Hack Event Nov 16 - OCaml Compiler & MirageOS
---

The evenings are getting dark - come and hack with us!

Next Wednesday evening (9th November) is our Autumn Compiler Hacking event at [Pembroke College](http://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/). This time we are opening it up to a wider group and we are inviting the [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/) team to join us while they are preparing for the new release.

**Projects**

If you'd like to work on fixing bugs, writing docs, creating tutorials, sorting through PRs, writing up some short blog posts or just learning more about OCaml and Mirage, then come and join us.

There are lots of mini projects for the [OCaml compiler](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) and [MirageOS Pioneer Projects](http://canopy.mirage.io/Projects) that you might find interesting.

Let us know if there is something you'd like to work on!

**Details**

We will be in N7 (through the second archway on the left) from 630pm onwards, please indicate your interest via the [Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/fsy7gue9xvbvvdm8), and let me know if you will be eating with us. You can eat in the buttery (between 545pm-645pm) or have some buffet food in the room itself - let me know your preference so that I don't over/under order on buffet food.

More details on the Compiler Hacking [blog](https://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2016/11/01/fifteenth-compiler-hacking-evening.html).

All welcome!
