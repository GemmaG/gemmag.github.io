Over the last year I've worked on a few t-shirt designs to represent specific releases and/or events.

It would be great to get some more ideas/designs for the future - perhaps even a community-led competition!

Huge thanks to [Indigo Clothing](http://www.indigoclothing.com/) who printed all of our t-shirts with a super-quick turnaround.
